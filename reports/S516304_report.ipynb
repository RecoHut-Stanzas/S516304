        "# CTR Models in PyTorch\n",
        "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a critical task for many applications, as its accuracy has a direct impact on user experience and platform revenue. In recent years, CTR prediction has been widely studied in both academia and industry, resulting in a wide variety of CTR prediction models.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will analyze 25+ of such CTR models, from the lens of RecSys and also go through a short tutorial of training 3 CTR models on a small toy dataset from TaoBao eCommerce platform.\n",
